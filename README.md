# MITx-6.00.2x

My solutions to problem sets of MIT open course 6.00.2x on edX.org, "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python." The full course material can be accessed via https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:MITx+6.00.2x+1T2022/home

P.S. It is my initial courses on computer science. So, there would be no comments and some mistakess in codes.
