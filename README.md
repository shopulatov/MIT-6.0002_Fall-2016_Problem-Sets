# MIT-6.0002_Fall-2016_Problem-Sets

My solutions to problem sets of MIT open course 6.0001, "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python." The full course material can be accessed via https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0001-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-in-python-fall-2016/index.htm. and videos via https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP63WbdFxL8giv4yhgdMGaZNA

P.S. It is my initial courses on programming or computer science. So, there would be no comments and some misunderstandings in codes.
