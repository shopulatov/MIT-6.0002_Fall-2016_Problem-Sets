# MITx-6.00.2x

My solutions to problem sets of MIT open course 6.00.2 on edX.org, "Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python." The full course material can be accessed via https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-0002-introduction-to-computational-thinking-and-data-science-fall-2016/ and videos via https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP619EG1wp0kT-7rDE_Az5TNd

P.S. It is my initial courses on computer science. So, there would be no comments and some mistakess in codes.
